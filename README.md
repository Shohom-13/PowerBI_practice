# PowerBI_practice
Hypothetical data has been used to practice visualization of data using Power BI.
The data was almost clean, however irregularities were noticed in casings of Product ID and Customer ID, which were later corrected in Power Query Editor.
The charts were prepared using (Ctrl + /) command, wherein Pie Chart, Donut Chart, Line Chart, Bar Chart and Funnel Chart was created along with KPI scorecards.
The raw data file along with Key Take-aways doc and Report has been attached.
